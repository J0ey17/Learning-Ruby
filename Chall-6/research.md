# Research on Perfect Power

If the full factorization of n is known, say {\displaystyle n=p_{1}^{\alpha _{1}}p_{2}^{\alpha _{2}}\cdots p_{r}^{\alpha _{r}}}n = p_1^{\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha_2} \cdots p_r^{\alpha_r} where the {\displaystyle p_{i}}p_{i} are distinct primes, then n is a perfect power if and only if {\displaystyle \gcd(\alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{r})>1}\gcd(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_r) > 1 where gcd denotes the greatest common divisor. As an example, consider n = 296·360·724. Since gcd(96, 60, 24) = 12, n is a perfect 12th power (and a perfect 6th power, 4th power, cube and square, since 6, 4, 3 and 2 divide 12).
